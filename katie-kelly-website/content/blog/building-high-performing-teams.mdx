# Building High-Performing Operations Teams

One of the most common questions I get is: "How do you build a great operations team?" The answer isn't simple, but I've learned some patterns that consistently work.

## Start with the Right Foundation

Before you hire anyone, you need clarity on three things:

1. **What outcomes are you driving?** (Not activities—outcomes)
2. **What skills are essential vs. nice-to-have?**
3. **What does success look like in 90 days?**

Too many companies hire for the present instead of the future. Think about where your company will be in 12-18 months and hire for *that* reality.

## The Interview Process Matters

I've completely revamped how I interview operations candidates. Here's what works:

### Case Studies Over Resumes

Give candidates a real problem you're facing (anonymized, of course) and ask them to:
- Diagnose the root cause
- Propose 2-3 solutions
- Explain their reasoning

You'll learn more in 30 minutes than from an hour of behavioral questions.

### Culture Add, Not Culture Fit

I look for people who:
- Challenge assumptions (respectfully)
- Bring different perspectives
- Ask "why" instead of just nodding along

## Empowerment Through Structure

This sounds contradictory, but it's true: **clear structure enables autonomy.**

Here's how I do it:

```typescript
// The Operations Framework
{
  clarity: "What needs to be done and why",
  ownership: "Who owns each outcome",
  resources: "What tools and support they have",
  feedback: "Regular check-ins and retrospectives"
}
```

When people know their swim lane and have the tools to succeed, they thrive.

## Measuring What Matters

I'm obsessive about metrics, but only the *right* metrics:

- **Outcome metrics**: Did we achieve the business goal?
- **Efficiency metrics**: Are we doing it smarter over time?
- **Quality metrics**: Are we maintaining standards as we scale?

What I don't measure: Hours worked, emails sent, meetings attended. These are activity theater, not outcomes.

## The Leadership Mindset

The best operations leaders I know share these traits:

1. **They're in the details** without micromanaging
2. **They celebrate wins** and learn from losses
3. **They build systems** that outlast them
4. **They develop people** who eventually surpass them

That last one is critical. If you're not building leaders, you're building dependency.

## Final Thoughts

Building great teams isn't about finding unicorns—it's about creating an environment where good people can do their best work.

Focus on clarity, empowerment, and continuous improvement. The rest follows.
